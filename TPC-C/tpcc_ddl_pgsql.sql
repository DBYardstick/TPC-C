/*****************************************
 * TPC-C Table definitions for Postrges. *
 *****************************************/

/*
 * The _ID columns are not required to be integers, they can be any data type
 * that can store a specified number of unique identifiers. See section 1.3 for
 * discussion about "N unique IDs".
 *
 * Some columns with NUMERIC data type do not require a scale (digits after the
 * decimal period). These can be converted to plain integers, perhaps with a
 * CHECK constraint to ensure integrity, if performance benefits. All that the
 * specification requires is that these columns be capable of storing at least
 * the specified number of digits.
 *
 * TODO: Have a second set of eyes review the DDL in context of Clause 1.3.
 * Specifically, we want to make sure that I did not miss any columns in the
 * table definitions.
 *
 * Note that the specifiaction allows for rearranging of the columns within a
 * table. So we can put the fixed-length fields towards the begining of the
 * table. There's no clear consensus of whether this optimization yeilds any
 * real performance benefit in Postgres, but we can try and compare the
 * optimization's performance later. If this optimization is ever tried, then
 * make sure that the order of the columns in INSERT statments is also altered
 * accordingly.
